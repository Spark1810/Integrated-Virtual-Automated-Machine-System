# Integrated-Virtual-Automated-Machine-System
The aim of this idea is to enable a voice commanded virtual assistant to automate tasks for user using minimal voice inputs from the user.

This system has its base in python language and it supports all versions of python above 3.7. It uses the wampserver software for the storing up of data.
Here the virtual assistance itself will create the database once the code gets executed and the database name will be automatically set as assis2 and the table name will be set as user. Our model specifically requires some library files that that has to be pre-installed in the system and it also have a training model for the system on its own. It intakes some specific datasets for more making it more interactive and attractive for the user. We need to invoke the dataset from the folder and the path has to be placed correctly to fetch the datasetsÂ accordingly.
